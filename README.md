# EDA-And-Feature-Engineering-Of-Google-Play-Store-Dataset
Today, 1.85 million different apps are available for download, with Android users having access to 2.56 million apps through the Google Play Store. These apps play a significant role in shaping our daily lives, from productivity to entertainment. Our objective is to analyze the Google Playstore dataset to uncover valuable insights such as the most popular app category, the app with the largest number of installs, and the app with the largest size. We have meticulously cleaned the data, performed feature engineering, and conducted an extensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to achieve these goals. Through this analysis, we aim to provide a comprehensive understanding of app trends and user preferences in the Google Play Store.
